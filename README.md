# CyberShadowTrainer

Early stages of a trainer for Cyber Shadow. This release allows you to save and load X Y coordinates for Shadow.

## Important

**CyberShadow.exe must be set to run as administrator. The trainer must as well and should be set to run as administrator by default.**

**Only works for Windows.

## Usage

1. Download latest release under Releases. You'll want the zip file at the top (publish.zip).
2. Place the folder whereever you like.
3. Open folder and run CyberShadowTrainer_WF.exe
4. Run Cyber Shadow. If the trainer is open you should see OPEN in green and all caps near the top.
5. You can check to see it's working by loading a save or starting a new game. As Shadow moves you should see the X and Y fields constantly updating. 
**If they are stuck at zero, double check that both the game and the trainer were run as Administrator.**

- Current coordinates can be saved either by clicking Save Position, or by pressing the F2 key. Similarly you can Load the saved position with the Load Position button
or by pressing F4. **The hotkeys are Global, meaning they will work regardless of what window is currently in focus.**
- HP, SP, money values can be edited and loaded manually. They can also be locked.
- You can set the trainer to load the above values when Loading Position.

## Notes
- This is meant to be used per room. The trainer knows nothing about what room Shadow is in, only his X and Y position at any given time. Basically this means you should 
only Save and Load in whatever room you want to use it in. Don't Save in one room and then Load in another, you'll likely get stuck and need to quit out.

- I am not responsible for anything bad that happens. This trainer can't break your game. Worst case when messing with game hacks if things break just restart the game.
